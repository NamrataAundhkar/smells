Classes that are no longer in use will burden the system with obviously obsolete functionality. A specific case of this smell occurs when a class implements more than a single responsibility and one of the responsibilities becomes unused in the meantime. Unused classes mainly emerge for two reasons - a developer speculates that the class might eventually be used and a formerly required class becomes obsolete due to refactorings.</p><p>Related smells: <a href="UA2.html">Unutilized Abstraction</a><b> </b><a href="UP.html">Unused Packages</a><b> </b></p><h4>Reference</h4><p><a href="http://amzn.to/2rSdj7X">Lippert M, Roock S.
