A large size class is not only difficult to understand but also leads to other smells. As Fowler says "...a class with too many instance variables, a class with too much code is prime breeding ground for duplicated code, chaos, and death."</p><p>Related smells: <a href="IM.html">Insufficient Modularization</a><b> </b><a href="GC.html">God Class</a><b> </b><a href="BL.html">The Blob</a><b> </b><a href="TLP.html">Too Large Packages/Subsystems</a><b> </b></p><h4>Reference</h4><p><a href="http://amzn.to/2rblDm3">Fowler M.
