This smell arises in following forms: 1) if a file contains a declaration of more than one class or 'define', or 2) if the size of a class declaration is large crossing a certain threshold, or 3) the complexity of a class or 'define' is high.</p><p>Related smells: <a href="IM.html">Insufficient Modularization</a><b> </b></p><h4>Reference</h4><p>Tushar Sharma, Marios Fragkoulis, and Diomidis Spinellis, “Does your configuration code smell?” in Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories, ser.
