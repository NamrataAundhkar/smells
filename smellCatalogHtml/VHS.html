It is a smell as the behavior of the code is not explicitly defined, and depends on the field modifier (static or member), as well as on the implementation of the test framework. Further, field declarations are not restricted to the header of a class, but can occur anywhere within the class. Vague header setups hamper code comprehension and maintainability.</p><p>Related smells: </p><h4>Reference</h4><p>Michaela Greiler, Arie van Deursen, Margaret-Anne Storey.
