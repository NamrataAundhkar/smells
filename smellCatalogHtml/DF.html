Often dead fields are inherited. This can indicate a non-optimal inheritance structure, or that the super class conflicts with the single responsibility principle. Also, dead fields within the test class itself can indicate incomplete or deprecated development activities.</p><p>Related smells: </p><h4>Reference</h4><p>Michaela Greiler, Arie van Deursen, Margaret-Anne Storey.
