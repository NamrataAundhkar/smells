<html><head><title>Multifaceted Abstraction</title></head><body><h3>Multifaceted Abstraction</h3><p>Each abstraction (e.g. a resource, class, 'define', or module) should be designed to specify the properties of a single piece of software. In other words, each abstraction should follow single responsibility principle. An abstraction suffers from multifaceted abstraction when the elements of the abstraction are not cohesive. The smell may occur in the following two forms: 1) a resource (file, package, or service) declaration specifies attributes of more than one physical resources, or 2) all the language elements declared in a class, 'define', or a module are not cohesive.</p><p>Related smells: </p><h4>Reference</h4><p>Tushar Sharma, Marios Fragkoulis, and Diomidis Spinellis, “Does your configuration code smell?” in Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories, ser.
