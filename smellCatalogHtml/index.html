<html><body><h1>A Catalog of Software Smells</h1><p>Kent Beck coined the term "code smell" [Fowler1999] and defined it informally as certain structures in the code that suggest (sometimes they scream for) the possibility of refactoring. Since then, various smells have been reported that impair software quality in one or more ways. Therefore, in this attempt, we are presenting all the smell definition and related information in the form a catalog.</p><ul><a href="CODE.html">Code Smells</a></ul><ul><a href="CONFIG.html">Configuration Smells</a></ul></body></html>
