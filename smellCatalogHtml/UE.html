<html><body><h3>Unexploited Encapsulation</h3><p>This smell arises when client DESIGN uses explicit type checks (using chained if-else or switch statements that check for the type of the object) instead of exploiting the variation in types already encapsulated within a hierarchy.</p><p>This smell is also known as "Simulated polymorphism" [SISSy], "Improper use of switch statement" [Fowler], and "instanceof checks" [Van].</p><h4>Reference</h4><p><a href="http://bit.ly/DesignSmells">Girish Suryanarayana, Ganesh Samarthyam, and Tushar Sharma, Refactoring for Software Design Smells: Managing Technical Debt, 1st ed.
